#  Notes

Hi! 

So there's quite a lot more I would have liked to have done with this app, I think 2 hours is a very tall ask for the extent of the task. The API's aren't particularly friendly, and no designs is a bit of an extra headache as my implementation looks very basic / ugly. 

Note: currently I have added debug models to the app. The mapping does work, I am just working from abroad on simulator so the api calls on this wifi are very temperamental. You will need to remove these (See: MARK: Remove this for non-mocked). 

What I would have done:

- Extracted extra data, for example the date, and made it human readable (updating the design accordingly). 
- Looked at the icon mapping provided by the api but the docs are quite extensive. 
- Added networking / corelocation fallbacks.
- Added retry mechanisms. 
- Added tests. 
- Moved some of the calls in to their own app specific models (see func navigateToSettings())
- Lots more to be honest. 

It did say submit it in whatever state, so apologies for the state it's in.'
